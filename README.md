# deip
my copy of deip.io game, in which I want to be more original than most of other clones
I wrote it without any successfull help from others, just look at `deip.game.phy.Obj.Direction` for stupid geometry I made

# how to
theres `run.sh` script for linux if you want to use it, but it should work on any system just with intellij idea

# want to play
the game is always `jarOutput.jar` file, here's compiled for 6 java version, so just download it (maybe change name) and run

# probably won't be updated
I don't want to work on it anymore. Too long
